This repository collects my publicly available data analysis works on datasets from various sources including UCI repository and Kaggle

* [Absenteeism analysis project](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Absenteeism%20at%20work/Analysis%20of%20Absenteeism.ipynb "Absenteeism analysis jupyter notebook")
  * I replicated the study of the original paper that used this dataset [Application of a neuro fuzzy network in prediction of absenteeism at work (2012)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6263151/). I then conducted further exploratory data analysis to gain insights of how other variables affect absenteeism at work. The dataset was obtained from the [UCI data repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work)
* [BRFSS data analysis project](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/BRFSS%20project/brfss_project.html "R-markdown-rendered HTML")
  * This project is part of the introduction to probability and data course on Coursera offered by Duke University. [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) - 2013 dataset is utilized. I conducted exploratory data analyses using R language to answer 3 research questions, which includes finding out relationships between average length of sleep and numbers of poor mental health days, relationships between the diagnosis of kidney disease and subsequent drinking behaviors, the relationships between socioeconomic variables and health care access.
* [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Titanic/Kaggle_titanic.ipynb "Titanic jupyter notebook")
  * The notebook contains the entire pipeline of data analysis on the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
* [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Sentiment%20analysis/Twitter%20sentiment%20analysis.ipynb "Sentiment analysis notebook")
  * I obtained sentiment analysis datasets from Kaggle and [SemEval2017](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools). It's in the initial stage of the project.

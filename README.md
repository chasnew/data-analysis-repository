This repository collects my publicly available data analysis works on datasets from various sources including UCI repository and Kaggle

* [Absenteeism analysis project](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Absenteeism%20at%20work/Analysis%20of%20Absenteeism.ipynb "Absenteeism analysis jupyter notebook")
  * I replicated the study of the original paper that used this dataset [Application of a neuro fuzzy network in prediction of absenteeism at work (2012)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6263151/). I then conducted further exploratory data analysis to gain insights of how other variables affect absenteeism at work. The dataset was obtained from the [UCI data repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work)
* [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Titanic/Kaggle_titanic.ipynb "Titanic jupyter notebook")
  * The notebook contains the entire pipeline of data analysis on the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
* [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/chasusc/data-analysis-repository/blob/master/Sentiment%20analysis/Twitter%20sentiment%20analysis.ipynb "Sentiment analysis notebook")
  * I obtained sentiment analysis datasets from Kaggle and [SemEval2017](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools). It's in the initial stage of the project.
